## Welcome to networktivity!

Hi, welcome to the most fantastic app ever made! (Courtesy of Evan Vera and Eric Pengeili with love <3 )

## Sounds great, but how do I run it?

Well partner, that's entirely up to you, but I'll give you some options.

1. Use the Expo Go App (I would reccomend)
Simply go to the following url: https://expo.io/@devovevo/networktivity, follow the steps to download the Expo Go app, and run my app directly from any device of your choosing

2. Download this github, Node.js and expo and compile and run it on your computer
Now, this step is only for the very brave (it's quite a hassle trust me :<( ). But if you insist, here is the guide to get you doing just that: https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/. Once these tools have been installed, go to whatever directory you downloaded this github to, open up a command prompt or terminal (I'm on windows 10, so I only now command prompt), and type in: expo start.

## How was this project made?

This project was made with hours of sweat and tears, as well as 4 rewrites (really? really...). This app has been made in Xamarin Forms, Flutter, Ionic, and finally in Expo (which is technically React Native), so it comes from the bottom of my heart when I say irregardless of our performance here it has been a learning experience. I learned programming at a young age using Javascript (this is Evan speaking fyi), and ever since then anything involving coding has kind of been my jam. Expo fit pretty perfectly with my skillset since it is a nice meld of HTML, CSS, and JS, all things which at this point I have spent years working with. What I really learned from though was Xamarin Forms and Flutter, which taught me C# and Dart respectively. This final draft of the project was made in cumulutively about 2 days of work, and is a prototype of a social networking site.

## I have the app downloaded, now what?

Well eager beaver, now the fun begins! Start your journey by creating an account with the Sign Up button, and then feel free to check out the ability to update your personal info, post your thoughts and comments to others, and view other peoples profiles. The goal of this app was to create an application which could successfully allow people to post their interests and goals and find others who shared like-minded goals. Now, while it certainly isn't polished, I believe it has achieved this goal and could be used for this purpose.

## What next?

Well, my mind is abrim with ideas for the future of this app, but most likely it would involve adding profile pictures, the ability to add friends, send private messages, and be able to integrate geo-proximity to find nearby users (which was a feature in the original Xamarin Forms project, but has been cut from this rewrite due to time constraints).

## Final thoughts?

I don't know you, but I hope you like this app. Irregardless, have a nice day, and if you have the time listen to some DEVO (my favorite band).
